The file.read() method reads the entire file as a single string if no argument is provided or a specific number of bytes if specified, making it useful for reading small to medium-sized files. However, it can cause memory issues if used on large files. On the other hand, file.readline() reads only one line at a time, making it more efficient for reading large files where memory optimization is important. Each subsequent call to readline() reads the next line, maintaining the file cursor position. While read() is ideal when you need to process the entire file at once, readline() is preferred when handling files line by line to avoid excessive memory consumption. Understanding the difference between these methods helps in choosing the best approach for efficient file handling in Python."
